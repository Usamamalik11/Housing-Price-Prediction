# Project Overview:
I usually see a lot of projects related to housing price prediction on social media. Most of these projects are build around the data from western countries and is of no use in Pakistan. So I tried to search for a similar data which gives us information about housing prices in Pakistan. Surprisingly, I found a dataset in a good condition from one of the sites. the dataset was build using information from a famous real estate site known as Zameen.com. The dataset was in a good shape though the required cleaning was done and you can check it by taking a look at the notebook.

## Code and Dependencies:
Th code for the project was written in python using jupyter notebook and spyder. For deployment purposes, html and css was also used. The major libraries used were numpy, pandas, scikit-learn etc.

## Model Development:
I used three algorithms for model development. They were random forest regressor, xgboost regressor and gradient boosting regressor. After hyperparameter tuning the best results came out with xgboost regressor with an accuracy of around 78%. 

## Deployment:
I deployed the model on heroku so anyone can access it and check the results. Any suggestion for improving the accuracy will be appreciated.
